# Calculator App - iOS

The Calculator App is a simple and user-friendly calculator application for iOS devices. It provides basic arithmetic operations and a clean user interface for efficient calculations. This readme file serves as a guide to help you understand the features and functionality of the Calculator App.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Clear button to reset the calculator display.
- Decimal point support for precise calculations.
- Automatic calculation of results as you input numbers and operations.
- Responsive layout for various iOS devices and orientations.

## Requirements

- iOS 12.0 or later.
- Xcode 10 or later.
- Swift 5 or later.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the Calculator App repository from [GitHub](IPH-Technologies-Pvt-Ltd/Calculator-App-iOS).
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Connect your iOS device or simulator.
4. Build and run the application.

## Usage

1. Launch the Calculator App on your iOS device.
2. The calculator screen will display a numeric keypad and the calculation result.
3. Tap the numbers or operations to perform calculations.
4. The result will be displayed in real-time as you input numbers and operations.
5. To clear the calculation, tap the 'C' (clear) button.

## Architecture

The Calculator App follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which separates the application into three main components:

- **Model**: Handles the data and logic of the calculator, including the arithmetic operations and calculation logic.
- **View**: Displays the user interface elements, including the numeric keypad, calculation result label, and clear button.
- **Controller**: Manages user interactions and communicates between the model and view components.

The app's main logic resides in the `ViewController.swift` file, which acts as the controller.

## Customization

The Calculator App provides basic functionality, but you can customize and extend it according to your requirements. Here are some suggestions for customization:

- Add more advanced arithmetic operations, such as square root or exponentiation.
- Implement a history feature to keep track of previous calculations.
- Customize the user interface by changing colors, fonts, or button styles.
- Localize the app for different languages.
